Your GitHub README page for your CV template could look something like this:

```markdown
# CV

This is a template for creating your CV for job applications and other purposes.

## Preview

![CV Preview](link_to_preview_image)

## Usage

To compile your CV, you can use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/):

```bash
pandoc your_cv.html -o output_cv.pdf
```

You can also use your web browser and use `Ctrl + P` to save it as a PDF with the CSS.
```

Replace `link_to_preview_image` with the actual link to the preview image of your CV. This README provides a brief description of your CV template and instructions on how to compile it using Pandoc or a web browser.
